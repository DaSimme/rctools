# rctools
Classes and nodes for devices of functional RC-Models.
Written in micro python, developed on Raspberry Pi Pico (W).

The basic idea is to have a network (CAN) of microcontrollers in the model, and all equipment is connected to the closest controller.
This way wiring and electro magnetic interference can be minimized.

Controllers shall be able to be set up with simple WiFi interface, so that no coding is required to use the system.
